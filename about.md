I'm a software engineer that spends far too much time poking at computers to see what happens. In the past I've written software in C/C++, Assembly, Perl, Python, VBScript, VB, Java, etc but these days I tend to stick to the .Net stack
and mostly focus on writing distributed web systems. Clouds! Massive scale! All that jazz.

In my spare time I also run a small company, [Ask The Masses](https://ask.themass.es) which lets you get fast feedback, from real people, on designs, photos, or just about any kind of image comparison.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/MrMDavidson), or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/150728/mrmdavidson). And when I'm not doing all that I'm being snarky on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mrmdavidson), gaming, or spending far too much time and money [board gaming](https://boardgamegeek.com/).
