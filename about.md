I'm a software engineer that spends far too much time poking at computers to see what happens. In the past I've written software in C/C++, Assembly, Perl, Python, VBScript, VB, Java, etc but these days I tend to stick to the .Net stack
and mostly focus on writing distributed web systems. Clouds! Massive scale! All that jazz.

When I'm not doing all that I'm being snarky on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mrmdavidson), gaming, or spending far too much time and money [board gaming](https://boardgamegeek.com/).
